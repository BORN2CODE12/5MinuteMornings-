            Research titled “Don’t look back in anger!” by Brassen, Gamer,
            Peters, Gluth, and Bluch (2012) reported in Science magazine shows
            that minimizing our regrets as we age creates greater contentment
            and happiness. The research also shows that holding regrets causes
            us to take more aggressive and risky behaviors in the future. The
            most healthy and happy people notice mistakes in their lives and
            then choose to let them go. This written exercise crystallizes
            that effect and allows them to pass through your mind instead of
            sizzling your emotions all day.

            Research by Emmons and McCullough (2003) shows if you write down
            five gratitudes a week you’re measurably happier over a ten week
            period. Research shows the more specific the better. We know if
            people write down “family, food, job” or something similarly vague
            over and over it really doesn’t cause any happiness increase. Our
            minds don’t relive any specific experience. Try things like: “When
            Trooper learned to shake a paw”, “The moment I saw Ana bringing me
            a coffee”, or “How Antonio finally put the toilet seat down,” etc.

          <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4 min-w-full">
            The goal of the daily focus is to strip away the endless list of
            things you could do into a bite-sized list of things you will do.
            Why? Because if you don’t you will mentally revisit your could-do
            list all day. And that will cause decision fatigue. See, decision
            making energy uses a particularly complex part of the brain and
            we’re wasting energy anytime we’re unfocused. Having a finite
            nunmber of things to focus on gives us a clear idea of the day,
            making us much more productive are self-aware.
